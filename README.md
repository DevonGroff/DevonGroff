### Current Position: ```💻 Technical SDR @ Retool```
Hi, I'm Devon &mdash; a Technical SDR for [Retool](www.retool.com), a recent graduate from [USFCA](www.usfca.edu), and for the past five years I have been doing web design and development through my own independent agency, [DG Websites](www.dgwebsites.co). 

Recently I have been interested in learning more about NLP, as well as low-code and no-code solutions to common problems. My long-term career aspirations are to improve access to technology for all, lower the bar for beginners to learn more about technology, and to make contributions that are enjoyed by the users of the projects that I am able to be a part of.

#### Special shoutout to [Kat Fukui](https://github.com/katmeister) for the inspiration for this profile README format, which I found (*and you can find too*) through this [article](https://dev.to/web/design-github-profile-using-readme-md-8al) over at [dev.to](www.dev.to). Also used [Make a README](www.makeareadme.com) to help visualize Markdown while writing this bio.
